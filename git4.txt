             What we need to improve our book design is optical margins; 
             margins that line up the letters while letting the punctuation 
             hang over the edges. Though this technically introduces less 
             even margins, the tiny punctuation marks use less ink than the
             letterforms and are more or less invisible. When we turn optical 
             margins on,the effect creates an illusion of straight, tidy margins.
